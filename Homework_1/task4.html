			Hello! My name is Jack Gorlin. I am a junior from San Francisco, CA. I am a film major, although I am more intersted in short form content (like music videos and commercials) and photography. I've been a musician my whole life, and music photography/videography is my favorite type of art to create.

		<div class="med-paragraph">
			I grew up all around tech in San Francisco, and it has always fascinated me. After taking a data science class that used R my freshman year, and then Computer Science 1 my sophomore year, I knew I wanted to do more coding in school. Unfortunately, it's hard to take many coding classes without being a computer science major. Luckily you guys are teacing this course!
