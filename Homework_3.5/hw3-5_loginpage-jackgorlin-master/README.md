Login Page Mockup: An (un)scaffolded Bootstrap assignment
=========================================================

(February 2017.  Written by Duong Vu and Jason Wangsadinata)

In this assignment you will be continuing your journey with using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap framework by creating a login page. Find an interesting login page and try to make your own version of it using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap (as well as any additional resources you want to). Alternatively, you can imitate the Hype Enterprise login page design already provided.

Take a screenshot of your login page and include it in the final submission.

In the screenshots folder you will find an image of a login page for Hype Enterprise found online, and a screenshot of a knock-off made by us for a site called Hipster Desk.
