**Task 4 part 1:**

Here are some examples of how things work.

Given the three strings below,
```
"abrakadabra";
"mississippi";
"introtowebdevelopment";
```

The output should be:
```
{ a: 5, b: 2, r: 2, k: 1, d: 1 }
{ m: 1, i: 4, s: 4, p: 2 }
{ i: 1,
  n: 2,
  t: 3,
  r: 1,
  o: 3,
  w: 1,
  e: 4,
  b: 1,
  d: 1,
  v: 1,
  l: 1,
  p: 1,
  m: 1 }
```

**Task 4 part 2:**

We are attaching an example for a band objects collected from Spotify API, that we will be using for testing your code. The file is called `band_objects.js`. It is attached on Moodle and also as a public repository in the Comp420 organization.

Follow the format of the object structure, but feel free to modify the values. We are not giving example that contains article, so you want to be creative in figuring out how to test that. A common article will be `'A'`, `'An'`, or `'The'`.

Your output should be something like:
```
[ 'Bad Meets Evil',
  'Chiddy Bang',
  'D12',
  'Dead By Sunrise',
  'Deuce',
  'Flipsyde',
  'Flobots',
  'Gym Class Heroes',
  'Hollywood Undead',
  'Hoobastank',
  'Linkin Park',
  'P.O.D.',
  'Papa Roach',
  'Rise Against',
  'Sick Puppies',
  'Slaughterhouse',
  'Spose',
  'Styles Of Beyond',
  'Thousand Foot Krutch',
  'Trapt' ]
 ```
